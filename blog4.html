                    <h2>> INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <p>In the midst of market analysis and basketball statistics, I've been trying to carve out more time for reading. Between optimizing battery dispatch algorithms and analyzing price curves, these books have been my escape hatch into different worlds and perspectives. While I wish I could read more (don't we all?), these three books have left an indelible mark on my thoughts this year. Each one opened up new pathways in my mind, challenging my perspectives and enriching my understanding of the world in unexpected ways.</p>

                    <h2>> BORN_TO_RUN.EXE</h2>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Author:</span> Christopher McDougell</p>
                    <p>Born to Run isn't just a book; it's a visceral experience. It tells the story of the Tarahumara (Rarámuri) people and the greatest ultramarathon that almost no one knows about. Before reading this, ultrarunning was just a blip on my radar – I'd heard of Courtney Dauwalter and was vaguely intrigued, especially given my own background as a track and field athlete in school.</p>
                    <p>While I was recovering from accident-related injuries, my boss suggested this book, assuring me it would "get the engines going." He couldn't have been more right. By the final page, all I wanted to do was lace up my shoes and run – to run as far as my legs would carry me, and then keep going. The book tapped into something primal, a deep-seated human urge.</p>
                    <p>I highly recommend this one to any middle-aged reader yearning to recapture that feeling of boundless freedom we remember from childhood.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>> SPY_AND_THE_TRAITOR.EXE</h2>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Author:</span> Ben MacIntyre</p>
                    <p>The Spy and the Traitor is a breathtakingly real and utterly unbelievable true story. It recounts the life and work of Oleg Gordievsky, a Soviet spy whose actions played a crucial role in ending the Cold War.</p>
                    <p>This book is a true page-turner; even knowing that the events were real, the sheer audacity and danger of Gordievsky's double life left a palpable taste in my mouth with every chapter. I found myself constantly amazed by the twists and turns. In my opinion, this is Ben Macintyre at his absolute best.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>> DAYS_AT_THE_MORISAKI_BOOKSHOP.EXE</h2>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Author:</span> Satoshi Yagisawa</p>
                    <p>Days at the Morisaki Bookshop is a sweet and poignant slice-of-life novel, and a real departure from my usual reads. It left me with a powerful urge to dive into even more books. The story follows a heartbroken and desolate Takako as she moves into her uncle's bookshop.</p>
                    <p>Among the countless pages adorning the shelves, she finds companionship, comfort, and a renewed sense of meaning. This is a true comfort read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's struggled to reignite their passion for reading.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>> SYSTEM_NOTE</h2>
                    <p>These books represent more than just stories – they're portals to different worlds, different perspectives, and different ways of thinking. While my reading list for 2024 continues to grow, these three have already set a high bar for what's to come.</p>
                    <p>Have you read any of these? Or do you have recommendations that might top these? Feel free to reach out and share your thoughts!</p>
