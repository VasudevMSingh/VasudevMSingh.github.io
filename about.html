            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hey there! Welcome to my digital home - a space where I share my professional journey, personal projects, and evolving perspectives on the world. Think of this as a curated collection of everything that makes me tick, from energy market analysis to basketball statistics, and everything in between.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Professional Profile -->
            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
                <p>I'm <span class="highlight">Vasudev</span>, an energy analyst and project manager based out of Pune. I have 4+ years of experience in Energy Markets research and analysis, out of which 3 years have been at a dynamic and rapidly growing startup.</p>

                <p>Currently, I'm diving deep into US wholesale energy markets and leading the product development and marketing efforts for my organization, where most of my days are spent optimizing utility-scale energy storage plants, researching battery assets development and performances, and developing a branding and marketing strategy to bring visibility to the awesome work that we do.</p>

                <p>What really gets me going is the challenge of deconstructing complex energy market data and turning it into actionable insights. Over the past three years, I've developed expertise in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finding opportunities hidden in market data</li>
                    <li>Optimizing battery storage operations for maximum value</li>
                    <li>Translating complex market trends into winning strategies</li>
                    <li>Building tools that make sense of market chaos</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Education -->
            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>My journey took an interesting turn at <span class="highlight">Arizona State University</span>, where I pursued my Master's in Electrical Power and Energy. It wasn't just about the degree - it was about building a foundation in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The intricate dance of energy markets</li>
                    <li>The backbone of power systems</li>
                    <li>The tools to turn data into decisions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The global pandemic threw a curveball during my time at ASU, but it also taught me valuable lessons about adaptability and resilience. I completed my degree and returned to India, armed with knowledge and ready to take on new challenges in a familiar yet different context.</p>

            <!-- Personal Interests -->
            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                <p><span class="highlight">Basketball:</span> This isn't just a sport for me - it's been a constant companion from college courts to professional analysis. Whether I'm breaking down NBA games or playing a pickup game, basketball teaches me something new every day. The strategic thinking, teamwork, and competitive spirit I've learned on the court translate surprisingly well to the energy sector!</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Reading:</span> Fiction is my escape hatch from the world of data and markets. There's nothing quite like getting lost in a well-crafted story, especially after a day of crunching numbers and analyzing market trends. It's my way of keeping the creative side of my brain just as active as the analytical side.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Chess:</span> Currently hovering around 1500 on chess.com, and loving every minute of it. There's something fascinating about the parallel between chess strategy and market analysis - both require thinking several moves ahead while staying flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions.</p>

                <p>One thing I've learned in my journey so far - the best insights often come from unexpected conversations.
